# Exchange Rates

Source: The exchange rates for the current week (valid from Monday – Sunday) are based on previous week’s rates published by the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](https://secure.mas.gov.sg/msb/ExchangeRates.aspx).

E.g. Exchange rates for the period 4 May – 10 May 2020 are based on the weekly Average for Period ending 1 May 2020 from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Please refer to [here](/documents/businesses/retrieving-weekly-rates-from-mas(1).pdf) on the guide to retrieve the weekly rates.

If the relevant foreign currency is not listed in the Monetary Authority of Singapore, please refer to [here](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/customs-exchange-rates) for more information.

## Foreign currencies not listed in Exchange Rates

If any component of the customs value is settled in a foreign currency not listed on Singapore Customs website, that value in foreign currency should be converted to Singapore Dollars using the current selling rate of that currency from reputable sources such as banks in Singapore, local circulated newspapers, reputable news agencies or online resources, at the time when customs duty or excise duty is paid for the imported goods.

Note: Exchange Rates are applicable for traders/travellers making declaration to Customs only. Exchange Rates are subject to change without notice.
