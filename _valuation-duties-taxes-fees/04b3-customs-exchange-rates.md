# Exchange Rates

If any component of the customs value is settled in a foreign currency, that value should be converted to Singapore Dollars using the current selling rate of that currency in Singapore, at the time when customs duty or excise duty is paid for the imported goods.

The [exchange rates](https://www.customs.gov.sg/eservices/exchange-rates-and-currency-converter/exchange-rates) are available on a weekly basis to all TradeNet users.

An example is shown below:

**Question**

Company A sold 100 boxes of batteries to Company B at Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) US$10,000 but states that payment should be settled in Singapore Dollars at S$13,700. Which of the 2 currencies should be used to determine the customs value?

**Answer**

Since Company B paid for the batteries in Singapore Dollars, the amount of S$13,700 should be used to determine the customs value.

However, if Company B is to pay US$10,000 to Company A, then the exchange rate should be used to convert US$10,000 to Singapore Dollars to determine the customs value.

## Foreign currencies not listed in Exchange Rates

If any component of the customs value is settled in a foreign currency not listed on Singapore Customs website, that value in foreign currency should be converted to Singapore Dollars using the current selling rate of that currency from reputable sources such as banks in Singapore, local circulated newspapers, reputable news agencies or online resources, at the time when customs duty or excise duty is paid for the imported goods.
