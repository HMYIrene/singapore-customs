When preparing the import permit applications for publications and recorded sound media, please take note of the following requirements:

-   Declare the correct HS code and the corresponding product code for the respective type of product (e.g. comics, books, audio materials etc.) and type of consignment (e.g. exempted categories, non-exempted categories, offshore, languages etc.). Please refer to  [Appendix A](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/about-us/annexes-and-appendices/appendix-a---items-under-import-control.pdf?la=en&hash=1610DE043C3E3B177991558BB7036D7CD67C0281)  for the list of HS codes and Product codes.

-   Indicate under the "Product Quantity" field the number of titles imported based on the invoices submitted.

-   Indicate "NMB" under the "Product Quantity Unit" field.
-   Enter the numeric portion of the MCI permit number in the “Licence No.” field for declaration of import permits of Malaysian newspapers and periodicals, offshore newspapers as well as publications published in Singapore but printed outside Singapore and Malaysia. For example, if the permit number is “MCIP999012004”, declaring agents and traders will only need to enter “999012004” in the “Licence No.” field.

-   Relevant supporting documents should be attached and submitted together with the permit application.
