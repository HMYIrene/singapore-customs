## Workplan Seminar
Singapore Customs (SC) conducted the FY2013 Workplan Seminar at the Concorde Hotel on 11 April 2013.

During the event, SC unveiled the Customs 2015 Plus, a refreshed version of SC’s strategic plan. SC’s current strategic plan, Customs 2015, was launched in 2010 to set out our perspective of the external environment and strategic direction for the next five years. Highlights of the seminar include a video screening of the key contents of Customs 2015 Plus and customised breakout sessions for Singapore Customs to engage businesses at a deeper level on various topics.

Members of the trading community, including representatives from local and foreign MNCs, SMEs, business associations as well as partner agencies and supplier agencies attended the seminar.

### Information on Breakout Sessions

**Mutual Recognition Arrangements and Secure Trade Partnership (MRA/STP)**

This breakout session sought to inform traders on our Secure Trade Partnership Programme and it relates to our national and international imperatives. Officers also touched on Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) aimed at promoting trade security while ensuring the smooth flow of legitimate trade. Participants of this session got to know more about the benefits they stood to gain from putting in place robust supply chain security measures.

**Strategic Goods Control (SGC)**

This breakout session covered topics related to strategic trade controls and in particular, common compliance issues which companies faced when dealing with products related to strategic trade. During the session, participants were introduced to the Strategic Trade Scheme which sought to facilitate businesses carrying out legitimate strategic trade. Participants were invited to view a mini exhibition of dual-use items that have commercial uses but could potentially be used for the development of Weapons of Mass Destruction if these items landed in the wrong hands.

**Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)**

This breakout session was specially customised for companies who wished to find out more about the eligibility of their products under various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). The session also touched on the applicable Rules of Origin and the application procedures for preferential certificate of origin. Participants had the chance to consult our customs officers on specific FTAs of their interest.
