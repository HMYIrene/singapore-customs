# Enterprise Singapore (ESG) - Export of Rubber

## Export of Rubber

The export of rubber (including rubber latex) is subject to control. All licensed rubber shippers must indicate their valid licence No. in the "Licence" field. You must key in the number correctly, e.g. SS999 or DD999. If you declare through a freight forwarder, you should inform him of your valid licence No.

The HS codes for rubber can be found in [Appendix B](https://www.customs.gov.sg/~/media/cus/files/about%20us/annexes%20and%20appendices/appendix%20b%20-%20items%20under%20export%20control.pdf?la=en&hash=C7D8551EB5681E8AADFDB44D7CB3A75D2C517FF2).

Companies who wish to apply for a Rubber Licence, primarily in Dealing, Shipping and Packing, will need to apply from Enterprise Singapore.
