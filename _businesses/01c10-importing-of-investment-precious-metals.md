# Importing Investment Precious Metals (IPMs)

The import of investment precious metals (IPMs) into Singapore for commercial or personal use is exempted from Goods and Services Tax (GST).

You should first be familiar with the qualifying criteria of IPMs and  **conduct a self-assessment**  before the actual import.

For the full list of qualifying IPMs bars, wafers, ingots and coins and the respective criteria for GST exemption, please refer to IRAS website and e-Tax Guide "GST: Guide on Exemption on Investment Precious Metals (IPM)"  [here](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/GST/GST-registered-businesses/Working-out-your-taxes/When-is-GST-not-charged/Supplies-Exempt-from-GST/).
