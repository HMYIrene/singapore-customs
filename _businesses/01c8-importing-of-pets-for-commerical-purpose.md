# Importing of Pets for Commercial Purpose

The importation of goods, including pets, incurs Goods and Services Tax (GST). The GST for the importation of pets for commercial purposes is calculated based on the  [Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.app/businesses/importing-goods/importing-dutiable-motor-vehicles/establishing-the-customs-value) of the goods.

The National Parks Board (NParks)  [Animal and Veterinary Service](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs)  (AVS) regulates all importation of live pets. Importers should abide by NParks'  [import licence and quarantine requirements](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/pets/bringing-animals-into-singapore-and-exporting/bringing-in-and-transshipping-dogs-and-cats/general-information).

## Procedures for Personal Pets Imported as Manifested Cargoes
-   For personal pets that are imported as manifested cargoes (i.e. unaccompanied pets that are imported using commercial cargo forwarding services), the pet owner or his freight forwarding agent must obtain NParks AVS'approval before submitting an online [Declaration of Facts (DOF)](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41/tds/pe/appFormPEServlet.do?action=formPrepareSTDAlone&APPLICATION_ID=TXWP) to Singapore Customs for an assessment of eligibility for GST relief. For enquiries on the status of the DOF application, please click  [here](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41/tds/pe/appFormPEServlet.do?action=enquire&APPLICATION_ID=TXWP).
    
    If the DOF application is approved, the pet owner, his freight forwarding agents or pet clearing agent may inform their appointed Declaring Agent to apply for the Customs In-Non-Payment (GST Relief) permit within 5 working daysfrom the approval date of the DOF. A list of freight forwarding agents can be obtained  [here](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/resources/directories-of-service-providers/list-of-local-forwarding-agents). Please refer to the details on  [Documentation and Other Fees](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes--fees/permits-documentation-and-other-fees).
    
    If the DOF application is unsuccessful, a Customs In-Payment (GST) permit must be taken to import the pet instead. For more details, please refer to the **[table]** above  **on** **the Procedures and Requirements for Importing Personal Pets.**

If the application is approved, the pet owner will receive an approval email on his successful GST relief application, which must be printed and presented to the checkpoint officer at the Customs Tax Payment Office at the passenger terminal for verification and endorsement on the day of the pet owner's arrival. The pet owner shall present the endorsed approval email for collection of the pet from NParks AVS. Please note that the approval email is not valid without the checkpoint officer's endorsement.
