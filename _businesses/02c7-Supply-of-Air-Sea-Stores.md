# Supply of Air/Sea Stores

## Air Stores

Air stores refer to goods supplied for consumption or use on board an aircraft by the crew and passengers outside Singapore. This does not include jet fuel. Examples of air stores include food, water, cleaning supplies, medical supplies, safety supplies and spare parts.

### Customs Permit Requirements for Air Stores and Jet Fuel

The supply of air stores and jet fuel for consumption or use on board an aircraft does not require a Customs permit. However, a submission of "Monthly Statement for Stores and Jet Fuel Supplied to Aircraft" is required.

### Submission of Statement for Air Stores and Jet Fuel

Singapore Customs records statistics on air stores and jet fuel for consumption on board an aircraft.

The owner or agent of any aircraft leaving Singapore must submit to Singapore Customs, a monthly statement to declare the total value of air stores and the quantity of jet fuel supplied to the aircraft’s fuel tanks. The statement should be sent to the Permits Compliance Branch via email to [customs_tnreq@customs.gov.sg](mailto:customs_tnreq@customs.gov.sg), by the 15th day of the following month. If there are no aircraft departures or air stores/jet fuel supplied during the month, a nil submission is still required.
