## TradeNet Unavailability

In the event of TradeNet unavailability announced by Singapore Customs, importers who are unable to obtain an approved Customs permit will be advised to use a [Letter of Undertaking](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/business/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits/lou-template-for-tn-unavailability-6aug15.docx?la=en&hash=2FC5CEF4EFC59B24B34204EF62011F8A7E5FBC8E) to facilitate the clearance of their goods.

The importer should apply for a Customs permit for the goods within **3** **days** from the date TradeNet is restored.
