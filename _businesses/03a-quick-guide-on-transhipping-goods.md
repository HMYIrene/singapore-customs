# Quick Guide on Transhipping Goods

This page provides a quick guide on transhipment procedures for those who wish to tranship goods via Singapore.

### What are the Transhipment Scenarios?

Transhipment goods refer to goods that are to be transhipped through Singapore from a place outside Singapore to a final destination vessel outside Singapore, as evidenced by its accompanying supporting documents/scenarios:

-   Incoming Through Bill of Lading, Through Air Waybill or Through Manifest which does not mention any local party as a consignee or notifying party (i.e., shipper, consignee or notifying party are all overseas parties); or
-   Incoming Bill of Lading, Air Waybill or Manifest which mentions an overseas party as the shipper, and where the consignee or notifying party is a local shipping agent, Non-Vessel Owning Common Carrier (NVOCC), air cargo agent or freight forwarder arranging for the transhipment of goods through Singapore on behalf of the overseas party; or
-   Incoming Bill of Lading, Air Waybill or Manifest which mentions a local party as shipper, and where the consignee or notifying party is an overseas party or a local shipping agent, NVOCC, air cargo or freight forwarder.

The table below provides a summary of the transhipment scenarios listed above. Transactions that do not meet any of these scenarios are considered as imports and/or exports and must be covered by the relevant Customs import and export permits even if they remain within the Free Trade Zone (FTZ).

The transhipment of all goods is not subject to duty or Goods and Services Tax (GST). Please refer to  [Circular 01/2020](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/circulars/circular012020ver1.pdf)  for more information on the storage of liquors and tobacco products in the FTZs.
