# Overview

Singapore shares the concern of the international community on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and recognises the need for safeguards against the illicit movement of items through its ports that can contribute to such proliferation.

As a responsible trading nation, Singapore implemented the Strategic Goods (Control) Act or SGCA on 1 January 2003 to regulate the trade in strategic goods and strategic goods technology.

Strategic goods refer to items and their related technology that can be used to produce weapons of mass destruction, and missiles capable of delivering such weapons. This includes arms and military equipment, and commercial items that can be used to develop weapons of mass destruction.

Singapore Customs is the National Authority to administer the SGCA. The functions carried out by Singapore Customs include:

-   Processing of strategic goods permit applications
-   Registering and auditing of arms brokers
-   Conducting industry outreach and public awareness programmes
-   Enforcing the SGCA and its regulations
-   Serving as the focal point for local and international enquiries

Singapore Customs also coordinates closely with other government agencies such as the  [Immigration & Checkpoints Authority](http://www.ica.gov.sg/)  and  [Singapore Police Force](http://www.spf.gov.sg/)  to enforce the SGCA.

## Permit and Registration Requirements

A strategic goods permit is required for any transfer or brokering of:

Strategic goods and related technology listed in the Strategic Goods Control List 
Any goods or technology intended or likely to be used for or in connection with weapons of mass destruction.

## Export, Transhipment, Transit and Intangible Transfer of Technology (ITT)

To provide greater facilitation and promote effective internal export control compliance, Singapore Customs implemented the Strategic Trade Scheme (STS).  The STS applies to all businesses who wish to export, tranship, bring in transit strategic goods and related technology, or transmit strategic goods software or technology. 

The permit procedures under the STS consist of:

**

## Individual Permit

Individual Permit to be applied at least 5 working days before every export, re-export, transhipment or transit of strategic goods
ITT permit to be applied at least 7 working days before the transmission of strategic goods software or technology

**

## Bulk Permit

**

Pre-approvals (for a period determined by Singapore Customs) to be applied before the export, re-export, or transhipment of strategic goods, or the transmission of strategic goods software or technology.
TradeNet permit to be declared before the cargo is lodged with the sea port operators or air cargo ground handling agents, or brought into Singapore for transhipment.
For more information on STS, please refer to the STS Handbook.


## Brokering

A brokering registration is to be applied at least 14 working days before the brokering of items and technology listed in the Strategic Goods (Control) (Brokering) Order 2019.  A brokering permit is also required under certain circumstances.

# Preliminary Advice for Strategic Goods Transaction

Before you decide whether your business should undertake any activities involving the controlled transfer of strategic goods, you may apply to seek preliminary advice from Singapore Customs. We will assess whether the  [controlled transfer](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/overview/scope-of-control)  of your strategic goods is likely to be approved when you submit your strategic goods permit application.

## Applying for Preliminary Advice

**Step 1:** Complete the  [application form](https://www.customs.gov.sg/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links#StrategicGood).

**Step 2**: Attach the supporting documents, where applicable:

-   Technical specifications of the strategic goods (for example, operating instructions, manuals, brochures, data sheets, catalogues)
-   Business transaction documents (for example, contract, purchase order, invoice, tender requirements)
-   [End-User Statement](https://www.customs.gov.sg/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links#StrategicGood)
-   Export licence (and its English translation) from the originating country, or a confirmation from the originating country that they do not control the re-export of the goods
-   Company profiles/websites of relevant parties (exporter, consignee, end-user)
-   Other relevant supporting documents

**Step 3**: Submit the completed form and supporting documents.

Your application should be processed within 7 working days if the information and documents provided are complete. However, some applications may take longer to process, depending on the nature of the item, destination or parties involved in the transaction.

# Import Certificate and Delivery Verification

The  **Import Certificate and Delivery Verification (ICDV)**  complement the export control regime of the foreign exporting country.

It assures the exporting country that sensitive goods are delivered to approved end-users in Singapore, or that the goods are allowed to be re-exported through Singapore to approved end-users. The ICDV is also known as the International Import Certificate.

The ICDV is a 3-stage process:

1.  **Apply for an  [Import Certificate](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/import-certificate-and-delivery-verification/import-certificate)** if:
    
    -   The goods imported into Singapore are controlled by the exporting country, or
    -   The exporting country requests for an Import Certificate
2.  **Apply for an import permit**  via  [TradeNet](https://www.tradexchange.gov.sg/tradexchange/default.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=main_tn&_nfls=false)  before importing the goods
    
3.  **Apply for a  [Delivery Verification](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/import-certificate-and-delivery-verification/delivery-verification)**  after importing the goods, if the exporting country requests for such verification

# Sanctioned Lists and Red Flags

## United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Sanctions

As a member of the United Nations, Singapore implements the  [Resolutions](http://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/index.shtml)  passed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) through our domestic laws. These include arms embargoes and sanctions on missiles or nuclear related goods. Activities which contravene the decisions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in their Resolutions are prohibited.

Please refer to the  **[United Nations Security Sanctions](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions)** page for more information.

You are also advised to look out for  [red flags](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/sanctioned-lists-and-red-flags#redFlag) to ensure your trading activities comply with Singapore’s domestic laws and the UNSC Resolutions. Please note Singapore does not enforce  [unilateral sanctions](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/sanctioned-lists-and-red-flags#USL) imposed by other countries.

## Red Flags

Every member in the trading community plays an important role in ensuring that their goods are not used for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

It is important to know your customer and the end-use application of your product or the strategic goods you are dealing with to ensure your business activities comply with Singapore’s laws and the UNSC Resolutions and do not pose a threat to global security.

Below is a checklist to help you identify potential warning signs to avoid engaging in illegal strategic goods or UNSC prohibited transactions.

## What You Need To Know About Nuclear Materials

Nuclear materials are highly toxic and hazardous. Below is a list of things you should know before you trade or ship nuclear materials.

## Unilateral Sanctioned Lists

In addition to  [United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions), certain countries also impose unilateral sanctions.

While Singapore does not enforce the laws of other countries, parties in Singapore may be affected by unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries as they may have extraterritorial implications.
