# Overview

Singapore shares the concern of the international community on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and recognises the need for safeguards against the illicit movement of items through its ports that can contribute to such proliferation.

As a responsible trading nation, Singapore implemented the Strategic Goods (Control) Act or SGCA on 1 January 2003 to regulate the trade in strategic goods and strategic goods technology.

Strategic goods refer to items and their related technology that can be used to produce weapons of mass destruction, and missiles capable of delivering such weapons. This includes arms and military equipment, and commercial items that can be used to develop weapons of mass destruction.

Singapore Customs is the National Authority to administer the SGCA. The functions carried out by Singapore Customs include:

-   Processing of strategic goods permit applications
-   Registering and auditing of arms brokers
-   Conducting industry outreach and public awareness programmes
-   Enforcing the SGCA and its regulations
-   Serving as the focal point for local and international enquiries

Singapore Customs also coordinates closely with other government agencies such as the  [Immigration & Checkpoints Authority](http://www.ica.gov.sg/)  and  [Singapore Police Force](http://www.spf.gov.sg/)  to enforce the SGCA.

## Export, Transhipment, Transit and Intangible Transfer of Technology (ITT)

To provide greater facilitation and promote effective internal export control compliance, Singapore Customs implemented the Strategic Trade Scheme (STS).

The permit procedures under the STS consist of:

**

## Individual Permit

Individual Permit to be applied at least 5 working days before every export, re-export, transhipment or transit of strategic goods
ITT permit to be applied at least 7 working days before the transmission of strategic goods software or technology

**

## Bulk Permit

**

Pre-approvals (for a period determined by Singapore Customs) to be applied before the export, re-export, or transhipment of strategic goods, or the transmission of strategic goods software or technology.
TradeNet permit to be declared before the cargo is lodged with the sea port operators or air cargo ground handling agents, or brought into Singapore for transhipment.
For more information on STS, please refer to the STS Handbook.


## Brokering

A brokering registration is to be applied at least 14 working days before the brokering of items and technology listed in the Strategic Goods (Control) (Brokering) Order 2019.  A brokering permit is also required under certain circumstances.
