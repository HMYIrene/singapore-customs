# Sanctioned Lists and Red Flags

## United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Sanctions

As a member of the United Nations, Singapore implements the  [Resolutions](http://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/index.shtml)  passed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) through our domestic laws. These include arms embargoes and sanctions on missiles or nuclear related goods. Activities which contravene the decisions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in their Resolutions are prohibited.

Please refer to the  **[United Nations Security Sanctions](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions)** page for more information.

You are also advised to look out for  [red flags](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/sanctioned-lists-and-red-flags#redFlag) to ensure your trading activities comply with Singapore’s domestic laws and the UNSC Resolutions. Please note Singapore does not enforce  [unilateral sanctions](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/sanctioned-lists-and-red-flags#USL) imposed by other countries.

### Red Flags

Every member in the trading community plays an important role in ensuring that their goods are not used for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

It is important to know your customer and the end-use application of your product or the strategic goods you are dealing with to ensure your business activities comply with Singapore’s laws and the UNSC Resolutions and do not pose a threat to global security.

Below is a checklist to help you identify potential warning signs to avoid engaging in illegal strategic goods or UNSC prohibited transactions.

### Unilateral Sanctioned Lists

In addition to  [United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions), certain countries also impose unilateral sanctions.

While Singapore does not enforce the laws of other countries, parties in Singapore may be affected by unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries as they may have extraterritorial implications.
