# Importing Personal Pets

The importation of goods, including pets, incurs Goods and Services Tax (GST). The GST for the importation of personal pets is based on the  [Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes--fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/establishing-the-customs-value#CIF) of the goods.

GST relief may be granted on the importation of personal pets if:

-   The pet owner is changing his place of residence to Singapore and qualifies for GST relief. Please refer to the  **Importing Personal Pets for Transfer of Residence**  section below for the procedures to apply for GST relief; or
-   The pet is imported by  **air** as manifested cargoes and the  **total CIF value does not exceed S$400**. The table below illustrates the procedures and requirements for importing personal pets.

The National Parks Board (NParks)  [Animal and Veterinary Service](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs) (AVS) regulates all importation of live pets. Importers must comply with NParks' AVS' [import licence and pet quarantine requirements](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/pets/bringing-animals-into-singapore-and-exporting/bringing-in-and-transshipping-dogs-and-cats/general-information) and obtain approval  **before** importing the pets from overseas.
