## Imports

An import refers to goods brought into customs territory from an entry point or a free trade zone (FTZ), or overseas goods brought into a free trade zone for storage and pending re-export.

To import goods into Singapore, you are required to make a declaration to Singapore Customs. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is payable on non-dutiable goods. Both GST and duty are payable for dutiable goods if these goods are imported for local consumption.
