# Transhipment Procedures

The transhipment and transit of goods through Singapore are regulated under the Customs Act, the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act, the Strategic Goods (Control) Act, and other legislations enforced by the relevant Competent Authorities.

The transhipment of all goods is not subject to duty or Goods and Services Tax (GST).

**Transhipment Requirements**

A Transhipment Agent is required to obtain a Customs transhipment permit (where applicable) before the transhipment of goods. The Transhipment Agent is the party who arranges for the transhipment of goods through Singapore and can include a freight forwarder, Non-Vessel Owning Common Carrier (NVOCC) or shipping agent.
