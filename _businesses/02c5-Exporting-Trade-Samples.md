# Exporting Trade Samples

**Trade samples**  refer to goods exported solely for the purpose of being shown or demonstrated overseas. For example, trade samples may be exported:

-   To solicit orders for goods to be supplied abroad; or
-   To a manufacturer for the purposes of copying, testing or experimenting before being produced abroad

## Controlled & Non-Controlled Trade Samples

You are advised to check if your trade sample is a controlled item before exporting it.
