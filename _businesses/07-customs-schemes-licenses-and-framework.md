## What is it?

TradeFIRST stands for Trade Facilitation & Integrated Risk-based System. It is an integrated assessment framework that provides a holistic assessment of a company and determines the level of facilitation accorded.

The assessment is free and it is mandatory for all companies who wish to apply for a Singapore Customs scheme or licence.
