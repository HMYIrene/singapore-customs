# Controlled Chemicals

The Chemical Weapons Convention lists 3 schedules of toxic chemicals, their precursors and an additional category of chemicals known as unscheduled discrete organic chemicals (DOCs).

The schedules are organised to reflect the risk posed by the chemical to the objectives of the Convention, with decreasing risk across the schedules. Although DOCs are not directly related to making chemical agents, the facilities built for their production (with quantity exceeding threshold limits) can potentially be converted to chemical weapons production facilities.
