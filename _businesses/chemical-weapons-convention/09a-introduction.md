## **Introduction** 
The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is an international treaty which prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons and stipulates their timely destruction. It entered into force in 1997.

The  [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://www.opcw.org/)  (OPCW) is the implementing body for the CWC. Its activities include monitoring the implementation status of  [Member States](http://www.opcw.org/html/db/members_ratifyer.html), conducting on-site verification measures and providing a forum for consultation and co-operation amongst Member States.

Singapore ratified the CWC in May 1997 and Singapore Customs is the designated National Authority (NA) for the CWC (NA(CWC)).

The NA(CWC) is the national focal point and liaison with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (the implementing body of the CWC), and other Member States of the Convention. The NA(CWC) administers the  [Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act and its subsidiary legislations](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.app/businesses/compliance/overview)  to fulfil Singaporeâ€™s obligations under the Convention.

### General Obligations

Under the CWC, Member States are required to undertake the following general obligations:

-   Never to develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to anyone
-   Never to use chemical weapons
-   Never to engage in any military preparations to use chemical weapons
-   Never assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a Member State under this Convention
-   To destroy all chemical weapons and all chemical weapons production facilities that it owns or possesses or that are located in any place under its jurisdiction and control
-   To destroy all chemical weapons that it abandoned on the territory of another Member State
-   Not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare

### Verification Regime

Member States are also required to declare any chemical weapons-related activities and industrial activities relating to the  [scheduled chemicals](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.app/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/controlled-chemicals)  and facilities producing unscheduled discrete organic chemicals.

The declarations are the basis for data monitoring and on-site  [inspections](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.app/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/inspections)  at the declared facilities. These inspections seek to verify that activities at the declared facilities are in accordance with the obligations of the Convention, and consistent with the submitted declarations. It is a confidence-building measure for ensuring that Member States meet the requirements of the Convention, and serves as deterrence against any intention to contravene the provisions of the Convention.
