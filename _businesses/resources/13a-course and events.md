## **Courses for Businesses**

Singapore Customs has appointed Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) and Republic Polytechnic (RP) to provide a suite of specialised courses on customs requirements for the business community. This training collaboration seeks to meet the industry’s demands for more frequent courses while enhancing the effectiveness of adult learning. It leverages on the teaching expertise and pedagogy of the polytechnic professionals.  

Strengthening industry self-compliance will help businesses reduce compliance costs and enhance Singapore’s position as a trusted global trade hub.  

Companies may visit the  [Nanyang Polytechnic website](https://www.nyp.edu.sg/schools/sbm/lifelong-learning.html?id=other-short-courses)  and  [Republic Polytechnic website](https://www.rp.edu.sg/ace/course-summary?searchKeyword=customs)  to register for the courses.
