# Import Procedures.

All goods imported into Singapore are regulated under the Customs Act, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act and the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act.

Imported goods are subject to GST and/or duty payment. A customs permit is required to account for the import and tax payment of the goods.

**Dutiable goods**, which incur both GST and duty, are:

-   Intoxicating liquors
    
-   Tobacco products
    
-   Motor vehicles
    
-   Petroleum products
    

Ad valorem or specific duty rates may be applied for dutiable goods.

All other goods are **non-dutiable and incur GST only**. GST is levied at 7% of the [CIF (cost, insurance and freight) value](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.com/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes--fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/establishing-the-customs-value), which includes duties (if it is a dutiable good) and other charges, costs and expenses incidental to the sale and delivery of the goods into Singapore, whether or not shown on the invoice.

## Import Requirements

Before the actual importation, the importer is required to obtain a customs permit.

The importer is the party who imports the goods into Singapore:

-   For their own account or use; or
    
-   For the account or use of some other person
    

If an overseas company sold goods to a local company and the commercial invoice indicates the local customer as the consignee, the local customer will be the importer of the goods.

More information [here](https://singapore-customs-staging.netlify.com/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits) about the types of customs permits and situations where no customs permit is required.

Taxable companies should also check with the [Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)](http://www.iras.gov.sg/) on the arrangements to account for the GST.
