# Controlled & Prohibited Goods for Transhipment

Controlled goods require proper authorisation (advance notification, licence or certificate approval) from  **Competent Authorities (CA)**  before they may be transhipped through Singapore. You are advised to check if your goods are controlled using the description of the product, Harmonized System (HS) or CA product code  [here](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do). If the item is subject to control you may check directly with the respective  [CAs](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/about-us/annexes-and-appendices/annex-e---ca-helpdesk-lists.pdf)  on their requirements.
