# Find my Harmonized System Code

### Singapore Trade Classification, Customs & Excise Duties (STCCED)

Singapore adopts the 8-digit HS Codes in the  [ASEAN Harmonized Tariff Nomenclature](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/business/harmonized-system-classification-of-goods/resources/stcced/stcced-2018-march-2019-version/index.html)  (AHTN), which is based on the World Customs Organization (WCO) 6-digit level HS Codes, for use by all ASEAN member countries. To assist you in your self-classification journey, you may use the following resources to obtain the HS code for your product.
