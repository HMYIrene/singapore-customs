# Competent Authorities' Requirements for Controlled Items

All imports, exports and transhipments must be covered by the relevant permits.

If the goods are subject to control by the relevant Competent Authority (CA), you are required to comply with the respective CA’s requirements in order to prepare a correct and complete permit application.

Before you put up a permit application for controlled items, please note these 3 steps:

**Step 1**: Identify the item and its corresponding CA.

Example:


| CA Control | HS Code   | Description of goods                                                          |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IMDA       | 84713020  | Computer Notebook                                                             |
| IMDA       | 84433131	 | Colour 3 in 1 Printer Copier Fax Machine                                      |
| \-         | 42021110  | Notebook carrying case, leather with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 45cm x 25cm |

***
You may refer to the lists below for the Harmonized System (HS) codes of controlled items under the various CAs’ control, and the contact information of the CAs:

-   For the latest AHTN2017 HS codes, please refer to [HS CA Product Code Search](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do)  
    
-   [Competent Authorities’ Help Desks](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/about-us/annexes-and-appendices/annex-e---ca-helpdesk-list.pdf?la=en&hash=389D47ADFB0ABE83173CF4BAA6308C9466AF067F)

**Step 2**: Determine the category the controlled item fall under, whether it is:

-   Controlled & non-dutiable
-   Controlled & dutiable
-   Fully controlled & non-dutiable
    

**Step 3**: Comply with the specific  [CA's requirements](https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/about-us/annexes-and-appendices/annex-d---competent-authorities-requirements.pdf?la=en&hash=057440FE313CE92B2EDFD74E5E173D0CD9DEAD70) to avoid delays in processing, and obtain approval from the CA.

After submitting the permit application, you may be required to fax  **immediately**  to the CAs the relevant supporting documents with the Unique Reference Number quoted on the top right hand corner of each document.

For applications to the Controller of Undesirable Publications, the supporting documents  **must**  be attached to the permit application.
