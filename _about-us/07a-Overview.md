# TradeNet

TradeNet is Singapore’s National Single Window for trade declaration. Launched on 1 Jan 1989, it allows various parties from the public and private sectors to exchange trade information electronically.

TradeNet integrates import, export and transhipment documentation processing procedures and enables the trade and logistics communities to fulfil their trade formalities.

Through TradeNet, Singapore Customs and other Competent Authorities monitor the movement of goods and enforce health, safety and other regulatory requirements.

TradeNet  reduces the cost and time to prepare, submit and process trade documents. It expedites the clearance of cargo and allows fees and taxes to be deducted electronically.

TradeNet has been the focus of several academic studies since its introduction. Below is a non-exhaustive list of published journal articles about TradeNet:

-   King, J. and Konsynski, B. Singapore TradeNet: A Tale of One City . Harvard Business School, Case 9-191-009, Cambridge, MA, 1990.
