## International Relations

Singapore Customs participates actively in international and regional customs fora to work with other Customs administrations to facilitate international trade. The key fora that Singapore Customs attend are:

### World Customs Organisation (WCO)

The [World Customs Organisation](http://www.wcoomd.org/en.aspx) (WCO) is an independent intergovernmental body whose mission is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of customs administrations. Singapore became a member of the WCO in 1975.

### Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)

The [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation](http://www.apec.org/) (APEC) was established in 1989 in response to the growing interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies.

Singapore Customs participates in the Sub-Committee on Customs Procedures (SCCP). The main objectives of the SCCP are to simplify and harmonise regional customs procedures to ensure that goods and services move efficiently, effectively and safely through the region, and to facilitate border control.

### Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)

The [Association of Southeast Asian Nations](http://www.asean.org/) (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967. Several instruments have been concluded over the years to further the cooperation among ASEAN customs administrations.

### Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)

The [Asia-Europe Meeting](http://www.aseminfoboard.org/) (ASEM) is an informal process of dialogue and cooperation bringing together European and Asian countries. The first ASEM Summit was held in 1996. Singapore Customs participates in the ASEM Working Group on Customs Matters (AWC) and ASEM Customs Director-Generals/Commissioners Meeting.

## Capacity Building

Knowledge- Based Service (KBS)

To support ASEAN community-building efforts, Singapore Customs participates in the ASEAN Customs Capacity Building Working Group (CCBWG), which aims to promote best practices to improve technical and professional capabilities of Customs Personnel. A [Knowledge-Based Service (KBS) website](http://kbscustoms.asean.org/) was developed by Thai Customs to enhance awareness of CCBWGâ€™s work and promote knowledge-sharing amongst ASEAN Customs administrations.
